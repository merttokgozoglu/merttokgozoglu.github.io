Hello! I'm Mert Tokgözoğlu. I'm known for my dedication to open source and free software philosophy. In my professional life, I play active roles in developing highly available (HA) architectures for high-traffic environments. As the Senior Technical Operations Manager at Vargonen, I bring extensive knowledge in cloud computing and cybersecurity to create value with my teams. I don't just promote the value of free software in my professional life; I also contribute voluntarily and share knowledge through teaching experiences. 

My advocacy for free software extends beyond my professional pursuits, as I wholeheartedly dedicate my time and knowledge to voluntary efforts. My contributions to the technology community are not only a testament to my passion for open source but also a reflection of my strong belief in the power of knowledge sharing and volunteerism. Below, you'll find more about my professional journey, events I've been part of, and my projects.



## Volunteering and Teaching
With my voluntary efforts and teaching experiences, I take an active role on platforms such as the [Linux Users Association (LKD)](https://www.lkd.org.tr/) and [Mustafa Akgül Free Software Camps](https://www.lkd.org.tr/projelerimiz/mustafa-akgul-ozgur-yazilim-kampi/), supporting individuals and the community in gaining knowledge and skills about open source software and technologies.\

While my virtualization voyage commenced with VMware Workstation, it soon transformed into a dynamic and diverse exploration. VMware Workstation was just the beginning, and I quickly broadened my horizons. Notably, I've dedicated substantial time to working with OnApp. Furthermore, my current focus revolves around actively contributing to the development of modules for OpenStack, Proxmox, and, most notably, Ceph – a testament to my unwavering commitment to open-source solutions.

This deep dive into OpenStack, Proxmox, and Ceph has equipped me with extensive hands-on experience. These technologies serve as the cornerstone of modern cloud infrastructure, and my proficiency empowers me to make substantial contributions to their advancement and practical implementation.

In the realm of cloud computing and virtualization, ensuring the reliability, accessibility, and peak performance of today's infrastructure and services is paramount. Beyond exploration, I've embarked on special projects, including the successful implementation of elastic cloud solutions like AWS Elastic Beanstalk within private cloud environments.

My journey in virtualization and cloud technology is characterized not only by a continuous thirst for knowledge and practical expertise but also by a humble dedication to open-source principles. This steadfast commitment enables me to adapt to evolving technologies and actively shape their evolution.
